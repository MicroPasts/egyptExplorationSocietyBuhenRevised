This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society excavations at Buhen 
during 1958. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. They would like the 
following information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. These fields are:

* Description
* Object number
* Provenance
* Distribution
* Your comments
* Scale

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteer Anouk Everts for the 2014-15 volunteer projects.
