This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society excavations at Buhen 
during 1962 - 1963. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. They would like the 
following information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. These fields are:

* Description
* Object number
* Provenance
* Distribution
* Your comments
* Scale

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteer Anouk Everts for the 2014-15 volunteer projects.
